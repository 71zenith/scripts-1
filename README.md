# This repo contains the various scripts (usually dmenu prompts) and the .desktop files that I use on my Linux Desktop

## Contributing

I am still very new to shell scripting so if you find a bug in the script, do let me know. I am all for improvement.
All of these scripts are meant to be POSIX compliant. I do regularly check them but still if you find any thing not POSIX compliant do let me know.

## Acknowledgement

Some of these are from other people whom I have referenced in the respective files
